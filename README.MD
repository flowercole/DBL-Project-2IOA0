# DBL WebTech Group 26

This is the visualization project of Group 26. 

## Short description
The project is made using a custom web server based on the Node.js web api. The visualizations are created using a number of graphing libraries for javascript, namely D3.js and Plotly.js

## Getting started

This project is available online at https://dbl-viz.herokuapp.com/ . Due to the fact that we are using the free tier of the platform, the perfomrnace for large datasets will be bottlenecked.

### Local setup
#### Prerequisites
The only requirement for running this project is Node.js. 
No external dependencies on npm packages are present since we want to

#### Running the application locally
After cloning the repo, in order to run the app, in the project root directory, use the following terminal command:
```
node index.js
```
If you have npm installed:
```
npm start
```
also works. 
For live reloading a tool such as nodemon can be used https://nodemon.io/. 
You should be able to see it in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000 (the port can be changed in the config.js file or by providing the PORT_ENV enviroment variable)

The project has the following structure:
