# DBL WebTech Group 26

This is the visualization project of Group 26.

## Short description
The project is made using a custom web server based on Node.js. The visualizations are created using a number of graphing libraries for javascript, namely D3.js and Plotly.js

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
The only requirement for running this project is Node.js. 
No external dependencies on npm packages are present since we want to

### Running the application
~~First, for using https, create a https folder in the root of the project, and fill in a certificate (in a file cert.pem) and a key (key.pem). This can be done using this website https://www.sslchecker.com/csr/self_signed or from the terminal with Openssl.~~ For convenience, the https folder is already present.

Secondly, to run the app, in the project root directory, use the following terminal command:
```
node index.js
```
Or, if you have npm installed:
```
npm start
```
also works.
You should be able to see it in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000
